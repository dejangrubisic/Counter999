# Counter999
This project implements the simple counter from 0 to 999 in VHDL with possibility of increasing range and uses NClaunch tool to simulate
and analyse the results. Cadence RTL compiler is used to generate electrical scheme in 0.35um CMOS technology. First Encounter tool is used
to generate physical implementation (layout) of designed circuit.
